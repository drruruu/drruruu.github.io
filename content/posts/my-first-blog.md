## Introduction
Substitution-Permutation Networks (SPNs) are cryptographic structures used in modern block ciphers, enabling secure data encryption. They provide a foundation for algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

## How SPNs Work
An SPN works through multiple rounds of transformations, ensuring confusion and diffusion in the encrypted data.

### Key Steps:
1. **Substitution:**
   - Data is divided into smaller blocks.
   - Each block passes through a substitution box (S-box), replacing the input with a corresponding output.

2. **Permutation:**
   - The substituted blocks are rearranged based on a fixed pattern to mix data more thoroughly.

3. **Key Mixing:**
   - A round key generated from the main key is XORed with the data to ensure secrecy.

4. **Multiple Rounds:**
   - These steps are repeated several times to strengthen the encryption.

## Why Use SPNs?
SPNs provide:
- **Strong Security:** Their layered structure makes data hard to reverse-engineer.
- **Scalability:** They can adapt to various block and key sizes.
- **Proven Use Cases:** AES, a widely used standard, builds on SPN principles.

## Conclusion
Substitution-Permutation Networks form the core of many secure encryption algorithms. Understanding SPNs helps demystify how sensitive data stays protected in today’s digital world.
